\begin{section}{Source Code of the Dashboard}
	\label{appendix:source-code}
	The source code for the dashboard application is available on the attached CD in the~\texttt{dashboard\_app.zip} file,
	alongside the Thesis itself and Extended Summary in PDF a format\footnote{Both the source code and thesis are also available on a~\href{https://github.com/filipditrich/master-thesis}{\texttt{GitHub repository}}}.

	The application is built using Python 3.9\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/}}, and its requirements are listed in the~\texttt{requirements.txt} file.
	However, as explained in the thesis, this application depends on a local PostgreSQL database, which is not included in the source code.

	The application is structured as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{assets/}: directory with CSS stylesheets
		\item \texttt{sections/}: directory with implementation of dashboard sections
		\item \texttt{\_chart\_utils.py}: utility functions for chart generation, SankeyDiagram implementation
		\item \texttt{\_dash\_utils.py}: utility functions for Dash
		\item \texttt{\_db\_utils.py}: common database utility functions with query manager implementation
		\item \texttt{\_format\_utils.py}: utility functions for data formatting
		\item \texttt{\_query\_manager.py}: registered SQL queries
		\item \texttt{app.py}: the main Dash application implementation
	\end{itemize}

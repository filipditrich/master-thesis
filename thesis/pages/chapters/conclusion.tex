\begin{section}{Professional Impact and Outcomes}
	\label{sec:future-impact}

	The main personal motivation for this thesis was to learn more about the data and demonstrate the findings in an interactive way, leading to more insights and knowledge for future updates of the NFCtron Hub dashboard.

	The research and analysis process has already given new valuable insights and knowledge about the data, the SQL techniques and optimization methods.
	Thanks to this, I was able to manage and deliver, together with my team, two significant updates to NFCtron Hub's analytical capabilities in late 2024.

	These included new time-based visualizations for ticket sales breakdowns and a comprehensive timeline view of festival activities including sales, refunds, arrivals, and customer ratings.
	A simple preview of this new timeline component can be seen in~\autoref{fig:hub-chart-update} below.

	Also, thanks to the analytical findings and problems encountered during the analysis, I was able to provide valuable feedback to the development team.
	This will lead to improvements in the data collection process and the data model of the system, which will make future analysis easier and more efficient.

	Finally, the knowledge acquired by this thesis still shapes our product development and enables us to provide more advanced analytical capabilities to our clients – festival organizers.
	Future development will build upon these foundations, further expanding the analytical capabilities of NFCtron's system.

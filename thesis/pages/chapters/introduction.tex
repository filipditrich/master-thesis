\section*{Background and Motivation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:introduction-background-motivation}
Payments at festivals are a crucial part of the successful event management.
The shift from cash to cashless payments has been a significant trend in the last decade that has brought many benefits to both festival organizers and attendees\cite{bl_en_waarom_festivals_overstappen_op_cashless_betalen}.

However, traditional cashless payment systems using payment terminals are not only expensive to reliably implement at a venue, where the internet connection is often unreliable, but also do not provide any insights into the data generated by the transactions.
In the best case scenario, the organizers are able to generate a report of processed transactions made by each terminal.

Which, frankly, is not enough to make any actionable decisions based on the data.
Moreover, given the event organizers are not data scientists, they often lack the knowledge and tools to analyze the data and extract valuable insights from it.

That is where NFCtron comes in and offers a solution that not only provides a reliable cashless payment system, with credit-based NFC chip bracelets supporting offline mode or card terminal payment solutions, but also provides a comprehensive B2B platform.
This platform allows organizers, vendors, and event third-party partners to benefit from the data that the system operates with\cite{nfctron_en_company}.

The system is a full-scope solution that provides from initial online ticket sales and online credit top-up, through attendee check-in, on-site credit top-up, attendee access control, security monitoring, vendor sales, and inventory management.
Most importantly, it provides fast and reliable payment processing with the real-time data analytics and reporting, all the way to the post-event automatic settlement and reporting.

It simply provides everything an event organizer needs to successfully and efficiently manage their event without the need to worry about any technicalities or staff management.
NFCtron not only provides the system as a service, but also experienced Event Managers, cashiers, check-in brigadiers, and other staff to operate the system and the event itself.
This allows organizers to focus on the event communication, marketing, line-ups, and other important aspects of the event.

Put, NFCtron offers organizers a peace of mind and a guarantee that their event will be a success.

\subsection*{NFCtron Company}
\label{subsec:introduction-background-motivation-nfctron}
NFCtron is a Czech company that has been operating since around 2019.
In its early beginning during a COVID-19 pandemic was on the verge of survival because of the event industry being paralyzed by the government restrictions.
However, the company survived and even in these challenging times managed to turn the disadvantage into an advantage by focusing on the core system and product development\cite{nfctron_en_about_us}.

Years later, the system became robust and reliable.
It is now used by many event organizers across the Czech Republic and Slovakia and is currently expanding to other countries in Central Europe such as Austria\cite{nfctron_blog_nfctron_austria_events_festivals_september_visitors_payments}, Poland, and Germany.
In its primary market – the Czech Republic – NFCtron penetrated the market and is now the leading cashless payment system provider for festivals and other events.

In recent years, the company has also been focusing on expanding to the Payments market, focusing both on Card Acquiring and Card Issuing.
From the acquiring part, it is now actively developing its own SoftPOS solution that will allow vendors to accept payments via mobile phones.
On the other hand, on the Issuing part, it is also working on Card Issuing; that will allow the company to issue its own NFCtron branded payment cards in cooperation with Mastercard\cite{nfctron_blog_nfctron_keynote_mastercard_cashless_event}.

A big part of the successful market penetration was the company's focus on the business-to-business (B2B) side with the event organizers.
Giving the organizers amounts of data improving their decision-making and providing them with insights allowing them to optimize their events.
And most importantly, providing them with economic aspects and cashflow optimizations that allow many events and festivals to survive and continue to operate.

\subsection*{Personal Position and Motivation}
\label{subsec:introduction-background-motivation}
I have been with the company from the COVID-19 times.
My current position is a Chief Product Officer (CPO), and I am responsible for the product development and the product management of all the products and services that NFCtron offers.
This allows me to have a deep insight into the system and most importantly, access to all the data that the system generates.
As previously mentioned, the company's success is based on the B2B side of the business, and that means services and products provided to the event organizers.

The main product that organizers have access to is the platform called \textbf{NFCtron Hub}.
My personal goal and personal motivation to work on this thesis is to discover new ways to improve the platform and provide even more valuable insights to the organizers.

\section*{Problem Statement}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:introduction-problem-statement}
Even though the system provides a lot of data, it still has a lot of potential to provide even more valuable insights to the organizers.
Currently, the previously mentioned B2B platform, \textbf{NFCtron Hub}, provides a real-time data analytics dashboard presenting the most important KPIs and metrics to the organizers.

These KPIs and metrics summarize:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Total sales}: the total amount spent on online ticket sales and on-site payments.
	\item \textbf{Total sales in time}: the total amount split into time intervals.
	\item \textbf{Total refunds}: the total number of sale reversals or refunds made including refunds from online tickets, refunds of on-site payments, and chip credit refunds.
	\item \textbf{Chip balances}: the current balance topped-up on the NFC chip bracelets on-site or pre-topped-up online.
	\item \textbf{Customer orders rating}: customers can rate their orders via an NFCtron mobile application, which provides the organizers with feedback on the vendor's performance and the quality of the products sold.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, it provides less clear data such as
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{List of vendors}: the list of vendors presents at the event with their sales and rating.
	\item \textbf{List of products}: the list of products sold at the event with their sales and rating.
	\item \textbf{List of sale places}: the list of sale places at the event with their sales and rating.
	\item \textbf{List of top-up places}: the list of top-up places at the event with the number of top-ups made.
	\item \textbf{List of customer chips}: the list of unique individual NFC chips issued to the customers with their balance, spending, and security status.
	\item \textbf{List of customer ratings}: the list of customer ratings with their feedback from points of sale.
\end{itemize}

And finally, it also provides unstructured data in the form of data exports in tabular format that can be used for further analysis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Product exports} – list of all products sold with summarized metrics.
	\item \textbf{Sale places exports} – list of all sale places with summarized metrics.
	\item \textbf{Vendor exports} – list of all vendors with summarized metrics.
	\item \textbf{Deal exports} – list of summarized sales made under a deal\footnote{
		A deal is an arrangment between the organizer and the vendor that states the terms of the vendor's presence at the event, the products they are allowed to sell, the price of the products, the commission the vendor pays to the organizer and other terms of the deal.
	}~between the organizer and the vendor.
	\item \textbf{Transaction exports} – a heavy export of all transactions made at the event.
	\item \textbf{Ticket redeems exports} – list of all tickets redeemed at the event.
	\item \textbf{And other exports regarding the online sales} – list of all online ticket sales, top-ups, receipts, customers, and other data.
\end{itemize}

With the above giving some initial picture about the capabilities of the system, the platform (and thus the organizers) still face several problems or challenges that need to be addressed:

\textbf{Problem 1}: The main KPI metrics may provide some core insights, but the other less or unstructured data is not used to its potential.

\textbf{Problem 2}: The organizers are not data scientists and need a simple and clear way to understand the data.

\textbf{Problem 3}: Even with all this data, there is still a lot that can be done to dig deeper and provide more valuable insights.

\section*{Objectives of the Work}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Objectives of the Work}
\label{sec:introduction-objectives}
With the problems stated above, the main goal of this thesis is to analyze, answer, and present results to important questions about the available data and the potential insights that can be extracted from it.

But to achieve this, it was a prerequisite to find a willing event organizer that would provide the data and would be willing to cooperate on the project.
Cooperate in terms of providing valuable insights into what they would like to know more about their event.

\subsection*{In Cooperation with the Event Organizer}
\label{subsec:introduction-objectives-cooperation}
For this purpose, I chose an undisclosed event organizer who has been a close and helpful partner of NFCtron for many seasons.
Together with the organizer in the first step, we have stated the following requirements to perform the analysis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Requirement 1}: The event and organizer should be kept undisclosed.
	\item \textbf{Requirement 2}: The data should be anonymized to not leak any possible sensitive information about vendors or customers.
\end{itemize}

The next step was to choose an event from which the data will be used.
As it cannot be disclosed any further, we will refer to the event as~\theEvent~and the organizer as~\theOrganizer.

Now the important information about~\theEvent~for this study is the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \theEvent~is a music festival that has been organized for several years now.
	\item \theEvent~took place in the Czech Republic at the beginning of July 2024.
	\item \theEvent~is a 3-day event with multiple stages and multiple vendors.
	\item \theEvent~uses NFCtron system for cashless payments and access control.
	\item \theEvent~had around 7,000 attendees in 2023 and had a roughly 43\% increase in 2024 to around 10,000 attendees.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Data Analysis Objectives}
\label{subsec:introduction-objectives-data-analysis}

The final step was to define questions or data analysis objectives that should be answered or achieved by the end of the thesis.

Together in the cooperation with~\theOrganizer~and several internal colleagues in NFCtron, we have defined the following questions for the data analysis:

\subsubsection*{Cashflow and Revenue}
\defresearchq{cashflow-total-revenue}{What was the organizer's total revenue and what did it consist of?}
\defresearchq{cashflow-top-up-balance}{How much and how was the balance topped up on the chips?}
\defresearchq{cashflow-remaining-balance}{What is the remaining balance on all chips after the event and refunds?}
\defresearchq{cashflow-total-sales}{What was the total sales of the event, how much of it was sold by the organizer, and how many external vendors?}
\begin{flushleft}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{cashflow-total-revenue}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{cashflow-top-up-balance}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{cashflow-remaining-balance}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{cashflow-total-sales}}
	\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

These questions should shed light on the event's cash flow and revenue sources, which the platform does not currently cover in detail.
Possible answers to these questions may provide the organizer with valuable insights into the event's economic aspects, allowing them to optimize cashflow and revenue sources for the following event.

\subsubsection*{Performance}
\defresearchq{performance-transactions}{How many transactions were processed in total, and when was the system's largest \enquote{peak} in transaction volume?}
\defresearchq{performance-processing-during-peaks}{What was the average transaction processing time during peak hours?}
\defresearchq{performance-delays-downtimes}{Were there any significant delays or downtimes in processing transactions?}
\defresearchq{performance-best-sale-points}{What were the best sale places?}
\defresearchq{performance-best-top-up-points}{What were the best top-up points?}
\defresearchq{performance-best-vendors}{Who were the best vendors?}
\defresearchq{performance-best-products}{What were the best products?}
\begin{flushleft}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{performance-transactions}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{performance-processing-during-peaks}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{performance-delays-downtimes}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{performance-best-sale-points}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{performance-best-top-up-points}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{performance-best-vendors}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{performance-best-products}}
	\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

The current platform already provides some performance metrics, but these questions should provide more detailed insights into the performance of the event.

\subsubsection*{Beverage Consumption}
\defresearchq{beverage-total-consumption}{What was the total amount of beverage consumed?}
\defresearchq{beverage-returnable-cups}{How many returnable cups were issued and returned/not returned?}
\defresearchq{beverage-popular-category}{What was the most popular beverage category?}
\defresearchq{beverage-top-beer}{What was the top beer brand, and how much was consumed and sold?}
\defresearchq{beverage-top-alcoholic}{What was the most popular brand of other alcoholic beverages, and how much was consumed and sold?}
\defresearchq{beverage-top-non-alcoholic}{What was the most popular non-alcoholic beverage brand, and how much was sold?}
\begin{flushleft}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{beverage-total-consumption}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{beverage-returnable-cups}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{beverage-popular-category}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{beverage-top-beer}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{beverage-top-alcoholic}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{beverage-top-non-alcoholic}}
	\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

Currently, a more in-depth product analysis is missing in the platform, and the most important part of the product sales analysis at festivals is the beverage consumption.
These questions should try to answer and give detailed insights into the beverage consumption, preferences, and sales at the event.

\subsubsection*{Customers}
\defresearchq{customers-total-attendance}{What was the total attendance at the event, and how many active customers were there each day?}
\defresearchq{customers-top-up-online}{How many customers topped up their credit in advance online?}
\defresearchq{customers-distribution-types}{What was the distribution of customers by type (on-site, online, staff, guest, VIP)?}
\defresearchq{customers-mobile-app}{How many customers used the mobile app?}
\defresearchq{customers-bank-cards}{What is the distribution of target banks used to refund credit?}
\defresearchq{customers-card-schemes}{What is the distribution of card schemes used to top up credit both on-site and online?}
\defresearchq{customers-new-visitors}{What was the course of the event in terms of new visitors? And when were the largest "peaks"?}
\defresearchq{customers-visitor-time}{What is the average time of a visitor from arrival to first transaction?}
\defresearchq{customers-top-up-peaks}{What was the course of the event in terms of topping up credit on-site? And when were the largest "peaks"?}
\defresearchq{customers-top-up-frequency}{What was the customer's onsite credit top-up frequency?}
\defresearchq{customers-drink-preferences}{What were the beverage preferences throughout the day?}
\defresearchq{customers-common-combinations}{What were the most common product combinations?}
\begin{flushleft}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-total-attendance}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-top-up-online}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-distribution-types}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-mobile-app}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-bank-cards}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-card-schemes}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-new-visitors}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-visitor-time}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-top-up-peaks}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-top-up-frequency}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-drink-preferences}}
		\item \textit{\rqfull{customers-common-combinations}}
	\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

The customer analysis is the most important part of the data analysis.
It is crucial for the festival organizers to know their customer base and their behavior to optimize the event and make it more attractive for the customers.

Currently, no customer analysis, other than the customer ratings and list of customer chips, is available on the platform.

Answering these questions will possibly lead to the most valuable insights about the event's customer base and their behavior that no other platform or system currently provides.

Making these questions crucial and most valuable for the organizer and for the platform itself.

\subsection*{Technical Objectives}
\label{subsec:introduction-objectives-technical}
Answering the above questions will require a technical solution that will be able to process the data and provide the answers.

The scope of this study is not to implement a new system or a new platform and not even to implement any new changes to the existing NFCtron Hub platform.
It is to find answers to the above questions, present them in a clear and understandable way, and demonstrate the findings in the form of a simple internal dashboard prototype.

The technical goals of this study are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Prepare, process, and analyze the data from~\theEvent.
	\item Find answers to the above questions and present the results.
	\item Implement a simple internal dashboard prototype that will demonstrate the findings.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Scope of the Study}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Scope of the Study}
\label{sec:introduction-scope}
To ensure the feasibility and focus of the study, certain boundaries have been defined in terms of what is included and excluded from the scope of the study.

\subsection*{Included in the Scope}
\label{subsec:introduction-scope-included}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The study will focus on transactional, customer, and operational data from a specific event, referred to as~\theEvent.
	\item Key areas of analysis include cashflow, revenue sources, performance indicators, beverage consumption, and customer segmentation and behavior.
	\item The data analyzed includes pre-event (\eg~online top-ups), during-event (\eg~chip transactions, sales), and post-event data (\eg~credit refunds).
	\item A prototype dashboard will be developed using Python’s Dash and Plotly libraries to present the key insights.
	\item The dashboard is intended for internal use and post-event analysis by the event organizer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Excluded from the Scope}
\label{subsec:introduction-scope-excluded}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Real-Time Monitoring}: While the dashboard may be designed with real-time data potential, this study will focus solely on post-event analysis.
	\item \textbf{Multiple Event Comparisons}: This study is limited to the analysis of a single event (\theEvent) and does not involve comparative studies.
	\item \textbf{Data Collection}: The study does not involve the collection of new data and relies on data provided by~\theOrganizer~and the NFCtron system.
	\item \textbf{Implementation in NFCtron Hub}: The thesis focuses on analyzing data and developing a standalone prototype dashboard, not on direct integration into the NFCtron Hub platform.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Limitations}
\label{subsec:introduction-limitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Anonymized Data}: To protect privacy, all customer and vendor data has been anonymized, which may restrict the analysis in some ways.
	\item \textbf{Single Event Focus}: Insights and recommendations are based only on data from a single event (\theEvent), which may limit broader applicability.
	\item \textbf{Time Constraints}: Due to the thesis's timeline, advanced features (e.g., predictive analytics) and technical implementations were deprioritized but will be considered for future work.
\end{itemize}

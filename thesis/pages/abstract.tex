	This thesis analyzes payment transaction data from a larger Czech festival that used the NFCtron payment system.
	The research is conducted on over~\fmtnum{141000} transactions from more than~\fmtnum{10000} unique attendees and focuses on 29 research questions related to
	Cashflow and Revenue Sources, System Performance, Beverage Consumption, and Customer Behavior analysis.

	The methodology ranges from establishing a local environment for the analysis, through data extraction cleaning and preparation for a local database, to data anonymization due to privacy concerns.

	All 29 research questions are thoroughly answered and presented with rich visuals using a variety of charts and tables in each of the four major research areas.
	Moreover, the findings led to the development of an interactive analytical dashboard prototype using Dash and Plotly technologies that demonstrates the key insights.

	The process of the analysis and dashboard development is thoroughly described in the thesis, including the main technical challenges faced and used solutions to overcome them.
	Although the dashboard app is still in the prototype stage, the analytical findings, data-obtaining techniques and anonymization methods provide a solid foundation for future development and have already contributed to improvements in the personal line of work.
